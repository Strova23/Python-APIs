# Working with Python + Random APIs
This is all my personal code that I've written while exploring APIs

### Spotify
discoverUltra - meant to create a better customized "Discover Weekly" based on my current top songs, however I realized the Spotify API for "get recommendations" was deprecated. So I had to pivot to just creating a playlist of my top songs
topSongs - Made this to just understand the API and how things ran, simple code to give top songs based on a given artist.
